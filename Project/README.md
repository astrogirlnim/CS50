# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

The title of my project will likely be VMSyms. 


## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A virtual suite that allows you to run multiple guest OS-es side-by-side, simultaneously, in the same window.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My project seeks to create a minimum value product computer application. The program will use parallelized virtual machines so that multiple guest OS-es can be run simultaneously. Ultimately, the goal will be to run more than 2 OS-es at a time, in separate side-by-side windows. Hence, it will allow the user to visualize multiple computer screens as if switching between desktops. This will negate the need to reboot when dual-booting, or rebooting virtual OS-es in a VM. I hope to make the software compatible with linux as well as windows: certain VMs which alledge to do the same thing exist, but only for mac PCs. Hence, the program will run multiple host OS's on the guest OS as if they were simply other windows. The program should be executed like most applications, through fetch-execute cycles or via the command line.

## If planning to combine CS50's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to CS50, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

I am not planning to combine this project with another course's final project.

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TFs below.

I am not planning to collaborate with any other students.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome for the final project will be to develop an application viewing window or a command line tool that allows the user to install and interact with one OS: hence, I shall attempt to build a simple virtual machine from scratch. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I think I can accomplish a simple virtual machine that allows multiple OSes to run simultaneously, while providing an aesthetically pleasing viewing window (that either fills the screen or can be displayed smaller).  

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I hope to accomplish a VM which runs more than 3 OSes in tandem and is compatible with multiple host OSes.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

To run the virtual machine, I shall need to gain a more in-depth knowledge of OSes, computer interfaces, and hardware. I will need to acquire familiarity with Assembly language and learn to code in it. Additionally, I will have to become familiar with Python or C libraries (as I plan to write the VM in one of these languages). Topics I will research include: virtual hard drive creation, data clusters, as well as virtual machine structure. My next steps are to seek materials and tutorials on virtual machine creation as well as Assembly code.
