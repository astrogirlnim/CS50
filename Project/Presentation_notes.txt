Describe the project in just a few sentences. *
1. LabRat: A platform where professors and students can upload lab information. The website posts lab positions with different interfaces for professors and students.

2.Online planner website which connects to the google calendar and makes it easy to schedule meetings between people.

Describe at least one feature that you particularly liked about the project. *
1. I liked the way the project presented users and lab posts ina  table at each tab of the website.

2. I liked that the website was able to connect to events on calendars connected to email accounts, as well as scheduled meetings that were convenient for different people.

Make at least one suggestion for a feature that could be improved. * 
1. The visuals of the website can be altered so that the tables are presented with different colors than the background. Additionally, it would be nice if professors could provide a link to the lab or the position.

2. I appreciate that the registration works with google authentication pages. It would be nice if the website faciliated multiple timezones.
