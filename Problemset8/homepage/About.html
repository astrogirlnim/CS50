                 Helping people is my passion.

                My career goal is to obtain a Doctorate in Biomedical Engineering and become a researcher in the development of advanced devices for surgical implantation. Specifically, I want to develop a surgical implant to service disabled or older individuals with bone or tissue complications. My father inspired this goal: his right leg is paralyzed, so he must use his hands and the bending motion of his spine to move it and walk. The recent development of fractures in his spinal cord has significantly reduced his mobility and quality of life. To that end, I’m currently dedicated to researching physical trauma and repair methods of surgical devices to service people like him.

                In addition to engineering, I’m a math tutor, programming enthusiast, amateur acrobat, and model. Find out more in the other tabs!
